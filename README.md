## DESCRIPTION

The File Handling Utility is a comprehensive Java application that demonstrates essential file operations including reading, writing, modifying, copying, and analyzing text files. This project showcases advanced file I/O operations with robust error handling and cross-platform compatibility, serving as a practical implementation of core Java programming concepts for enterprise-level file management systems.

**Core Functionality Overview:**

This utility implements eight distinct file operations that form the foundation of modern file processing applications. The program demonstrates professional-grade Java development practices including proper resource management, exception handling, and modular code design. Each operation is carefully crafted to handle real-world scenarios such as file permissions, encoding issues, and system-specific path handling.

**1. File Creation and Writing Operations:**
The application creates sample files with predefined content using PrintWriter and FileWriter classes. It demonstrates proper resource management through try-with-resources statements, ensuring automatic cleanup of file handles and preventing memory leaks. The writing operation includes comprehensive error handling for scenarios such as insufficient disk space, permission denied errors, and invalid file paths.

**2. File Reading Capabilities:**
Implements efficient line-by-line reading using BufferedReader, displaying content with numbered lines for better readability and debugging purposes. The system handles different file encodings automatically and provides comprehensive error handling for file access issues, including file not found exceptions and corrupted file handling.

**3. File Appending Functionality:**
Adds new content to existing files while preserving original data structure and formatting. Uses append mode in FileWriter to maintain file integrity and demonstrate incremental data addition techniques commonly used in logging systems and data collection applications.

**4. File Copying Operations:**
Performs complete file-to-file data transfer while maintaining original formatting, permissions, and metadata where possible. This feature demonstrates stream handling and data preservation techniques essential for backup systems, file migration tools, and data synchronization applications.

**5. Content Modification System:**
Reads file content into memory, performs sophisticated text transformations including pattern matching and replacements, then writes modified content to new files. Includes timestamp addition and dynamic text replacement functionality to show advanced content manipulation techniques used in configuration management and template processing systems.

**6. File Information Retrieval:**
Extracts comprehensive file metadata including size calculations, last modified timestamps, permission analysis, and accessibility status verification. Provides cross-platform file property analysis using Java's File and Path APIs, essential for system administration and file management applications.

**7. Text Search Operations:**
Implements advanced pattern matching within files with precise line number reporting and case-insensitive search capabilities. Returns detailed match information including context and position data for comprehensive content analysis and data mining operations.

**8. Statistical Analysis:**
Calculates detailed file metrics including accurate line counting, word frequency analysis, and character distribution statistics. Provides comprehensive content analysis capabilities essential for document processing, data validation, and content management systems.

**Technical Implementation Details:**
The project utilizes core Java I/O classes including FileWriter, FileReader, BufferedReader, PrintWriter, and File classes with modern Java best practices. Error handling is implemented through comprehensive IOException management, file existence validation, and graceful degradation strategies. The application follows object-oriented programming principles with modular method design ensuring maintainability, extensibility, and code reusability.

This implementation serves as a foundation for enterprise-level file processing applications including data migration tools, backup systems, log analyzers, and configuration management utilities.
